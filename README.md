### 1. What we did in this project

#### OBJECTIVE: In our project, we aim to explore 2 cases as follows:

**CASE 1**: Restaurant recommendations based on restaurants’ user reviews and photos

Restaurant review platforms have become our default way of searching for restaurants for every occasion. There exist straightforward means of filtering for prices, locations and cuisine (restaurant filters) and even broad categories of restaurants that you could sift through. However, when looking for specific attributes of a restaurant, or less generic contexts, this search isn’t as straightforward. For example, if a user is looking for a restaurant where they could have a platonic conversation, or take their boss out for lunch, they would look for restaurants with brightly lit/fewer couples and lesser crowds respectively. User reviews for restaurants DO contain answers to these questions! Most reviews start with the context of the occasion, company present and contain specifics on the ambience of the place. A user has to go through numerous reviews for every restaurant considered to see if the restaurant would be a perfect match for the occasion. This is too time-consuming a process. Our team is looking to provide a solution to this problem by enabling users to search for restaurants based on more distinct categories. Specifically, we will apply Natural Language Processing and Image Classification (and potentially other machine learning algorithms) to the restaurant’s existing reviews and photos to help users select the best dining options according to their moods and purposes.    

**CASE 2**: Creating a Winning Formula for Restaurant Success: By analyzing data and predict restaurants' successes based on Machine Learning model, we help business owners come to understand how their restaurant will give customers the best experience possible. A winning formula is one where you can clearly demonstrate customer value, and where your competitors are unable to replicate the experience that their food, drink and ambiance provide. Hence using the customer reviews we also plan to identify the key drivers of success and failures of restaurants, as well as predict whether a restaurant will succeed or not compared to its peers.  

#### DATASET: Dhe dataset we will be using for this project is the Yelp Dataset (https://www.yelp.com/dataset (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.). This dataset contains 5,996,996 reviews and 280,992 pictures from 10 different cities.
